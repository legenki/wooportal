## Detailed description

```
Nomada puts your browser anywhere in the world. Flip one switch and your geolocation, timezone, locale and proxy all change together — so every signal a website reads points to the same place, with no mismatch to give you away.

Most location tools only fake GPS coordinates while your timezone, language and IP still reveal the truth. Nomada keeps all four in sync.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHAT NOMADA DOES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🌍 Set your location
Pick a city and your browser's geolocation reports those coordinates to every site.

🕐 Match your timezone & clock
Your timezone shifts to the chosen city — see its live local time right in the popup.

🗣️ Switch your locale
Language and regional formatting (Accept-Language) update to match the destination.

🔌 Route through a proxy
Add HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5 or PAC proxy profiles with optional authentication. One click to connect.

📍 Use my IP location
Detect the location of your current outgoing IP (including your proxy's exit IP) and match your geolocation to it automatically — a perfect, consistent disguise.

⚡ One master switch
Turn the whole extension on or off instantly. The toolbar icon shows the active country and turns green when Nomada is on.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHO IT'S FOR
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Privacy-minded users who don't want sites tracking their real location
• Developers & QA testing geo-targeted features, translations and timezones
• Remote workers and travelers who need a consistent location abroad
• Anyone who wants region-locked content to behave as if they were local

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHY NOMADA
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ Everything stays consistent — location, timezone, locale and IP all agree
✓ Clean, modern Material Design 3 interface
✓ Live world globe shows exactly where you are
✓ Smart proxy ↔ location sync suggestions
✓ No account required — works entirely in your browser
✓ Your data never leaves your device

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PRIVACY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Nomada stores all settings locally in your browser. It does not collect, sell or transmit your personal data. The only network request is an optional IP-location lookup (ipwho.is) used by the "Use my IP location" feature, made only when you click it.

Open the popup, choose a city, and you're there.

## Single purpose (required by CWS)
*One sentence justifying the permissions — reviewers read this.*
```
Nomada lets users change their browser's reported geolocation, timezone, locale and proxy to a chosen location, keeping all of them consistent.
```

## Permission justifications (required for each permission)

| Permission | Justification |
|---|---|
| `proxy` | Route the user's traffic through a proxy profile they configure. |
| `storage` | Save the user's location, locale and proxy profiles locally. |
| `debugger` | Override geolocation, timezone and locale via the DevTools Protocol (the only API able to set these per-tab). |
| `scripting` | Run a small fetch in the active tab to detect the current outgoing IP's location through the proxy. |
| `tabs` | Apply geolocation overrides to the active tab and re-apply on navigation. |
| `webNavigation` | Re-apply the location override when the user navigates to a new page. |
| `webRequest` + `webRequestAuthProvider` | Supply credentials for authenticated proxy profiles. |
| `host_permissions: <all_urls>` | Location and proxy settings must apply to every site the user visits. |

> **Note on `debugger`:** Chrome shows a "Nomada started debugging this browser" banner while geolocation override is active. This is expected — explain it in the listing/FAQ so users aren't alarmed.
